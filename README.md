<h2 id="about"> 📌 About</h2>

PImage is a simple, interactive image mapping tool created as a lightweight solution for viewing and editing map-based data in a web interface. It consists of two modules:

View Mode: A viewer for loading and navigating map images with interaction points.

Edit Mode: An editor allowing the addition, modification, and deletion of markers and labels over a base image.

Originally created for quick prototyping and local demonstrations.
